# E-Commerce Using React Js

I built an e-commerce website that is for purchasing lab equipment or tools. schools and colleges are using it to shop their lab instruments from our website. First of all, I developed a home page to show the products if they are insured to buy the products then they would have to add the product to the cart after that they can log in and checkout. Secondly, I developed a dynamic dashboard for three types of users 1st Normal Users, 2nd Admins, and 3rd Supper Admins. and applied the crud operation for order, product, user, and so on.
